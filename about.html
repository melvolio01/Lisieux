  <div class="about">
    <p>Lisieux Stud is a family business, started by Michael's father, Dick Collins in the 1960s (date to be confirmed). It was named by Michael's grandfather, also Michael, following a visit to St Therese of Lisieux and a reputed lucky escape from an airplane accident.</p>
    <p>Michael completed the Irish National Stud training course (link to Irish National Stud website) where he was awarded the gold medal in his year. He also spent time in Kentucky, USA and Irish agricultural college. Michael brings dedication, passion and lifelong experience to his business. </p>
    <p>Michael's mother Bernadette is very involved with the business including with office support. His three sons, Andrew, Richie and John - still at school, all help out in the yard. Michael's wife, Barbara also plays her part and provides support outside her primary school teaching duties. </p>
